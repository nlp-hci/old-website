      <description>Why create this playbook? There is a lot of research happening at the intersection of NLP and HCI. However, because there are two different communities (ACL and SIGCHI + VIS) working on these problems, the differing viewpoints on similar topics are often not known to each other. We hope that this playbook bridges the gap between the two communities and benefits the larger community by highlighting possible research challenges, finding relevant publications, and identifying other researchers working in the area.</description>
